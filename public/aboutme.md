About me
Hey my name is Sebastien, I'm an American and currently live in Munich, Germany. By doing what I love the most, which is writing clean reusable code and designing simple modern things, I am able to create meaningful experiences through the interfaces I have developed. I am passionate when it comes to solving problems, and coming up with creative and timely solutions.  I'm currently focused on using React with Typescript to actualize great ideas. A couple of my everyday tasks include writing reusable components, building SSR / SSA / Static apps, managing their state, writing tests to ensure code doesnâ€™t break, and communicating with the Backend via REST, and Websocket API calls.
