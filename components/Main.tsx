        Hey my name is Sebastien, I'm an American and currently live in Munich, Germany. By doing
        what I love the most, which is writing clean reusable code and designing simple modern
        things. I am passionate when it comes to solving problems, and coming up with creative and
        timely solutions.

        I'm currently focused on using <span className='font-semibold'>React</span> with Typescript
        to actualize great ideas. A couple of my everyday tasks include writing reusable components,
        building SSR / SSA / Static apps, managing their state, writing tests to ensure code doesnâ€™t
        break, and communicating with the Backend via REST, and Websocket API calls.

        I believe that when finding true happiness in life, one must always seek and explore new
        ideas and not be afraid to experiment! That's why I'm not afraid with any challenge brought
        to me.
