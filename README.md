## Project Goal
I wanted a clean UI and design, but I didn't want to spend forever on it. This is the first implemented version.
This was meant to create a way for people unfamiliar with GitHub to have access and visibility to what I am passionate about.

## Further Implementations
Since this was a quick display of all my skills combined, 
I believe it would be beneficial if I continued to implement a full sized way of displaying my projects and their overviews.
Heres a list of features that have not been implemented quite yet but will be.
- [ ] Instead of Linking to GitHub link to a separate view, or URL page.
- [ ] Add a Light Mode for those who prefer it.
- [ ] Quick Unit, and End to End testing for future scaling
- [ ] Better UX design, people click on the mission points.

Heres a list of features where I'm unsure if its actually necessary
- [ ] Blogs are extremely popular but not quite yet sure if having one will help or hurt.
- [ ] A completely separate about me page, this would come after if my projects display begin taking up too much space
- [ ] Auto Updating Resume, this would be nice because I wouldn't have to reupload
